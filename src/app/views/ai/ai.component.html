      <p class="card-text">Machine Learning</p>
      <p class="card-sub-text">Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. The name machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Deep Learning</p>
      <p class="card-sub-text">Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.</p>
